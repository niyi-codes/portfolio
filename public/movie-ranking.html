 <h1>The Best Movies According to Victor </h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Jumong</h3>
<p>
    I can say this is the best Korean adventure movie i've seen so far,<br />
    The story line teaches one never to give up on himself and keep fighting<br/>
    for what is rightfully yours. 
</p>

<h3>Merlin</h3>
<p>
    Merlin is an amazing movie that i can tag whitehat & blackhat magical movie.<br />
    The storyline is about a young boy that shoulders the destiny of a great<br />
    kingdom, and the safety of it's people against ever forces that tends to use their<br />
    magic powers in the wrong direction.
</p>

<h3>The Bee Keeper</h3>
<p>
    The movie is by far the best action movie i've seen so far. It is about a man<br />
    that is fighting to avenge the death of a woman that commited suicide after <br />
    was scammed by an agency that belongs to the son of a corrupt US president.<br />
    This is a movie to watch anytime anyday.
